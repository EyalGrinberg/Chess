# Chess Game Project

## Overview
This repository contains two versions of a chess game project implemented in Python:

1. **Command-Line Version:** Located in the `cmd` folder, this version allows players to interact with the game through the terminal. It includes an option to play from a specific position (custom game position).
2. **GUI Version:** Located in the `GUI` folder, this version provides a graphical interface using Tkinter for a more interactive experience.

Both versions support all standard chess rules.

For an overview of the project, [view the Chess Game presentation (PPTX)](Chess%20Game%20presentation.pptx).
